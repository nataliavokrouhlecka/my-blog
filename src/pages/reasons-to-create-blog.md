I have been thinking about having a blog for a while. I wanted to have a place where I could experiment with new technologies and approaches.

At the same time, I wanted to share my thoughts and experience on teaching children programming, organising workshops for developers or forms of studying I enjoy (discussing books with colleagues on bookclub, listening to podcasts...).

Let's see how persistant I will be in contributing to my own blog! :)
