I have been teaching children programming for over two years. It is my side activity- my main job is web development. 

I have been thinking recently that giving other developers an idea that they could teach children too and what it can bring them could be a good conference talk topic. I visited a few web development conferences in recent years and this topic was not covered while I believe it has a great potential.

Then I was contacted by ngParty conference organisers whether I have any subject I would like to share with the community. They liked my topic and I started to get ready for the talk!

As it is my first conference talk ever, I want to prepare well. I need to say that I never thought how much time the preparation takes! I spoke on some meetups and other events but never in front of 200 people!

I am still doing research on the topic of my talk, gaining insights from my colleagues, thinking it through, saying my draft talk out loud to myself... I am really curious about the result and really looking forward to inspiring other developers to try to teach kids!
